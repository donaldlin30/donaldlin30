### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a fourth year undergraduate student at Davidson College in Davidson, NC, double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. Iâ€™m particularly interested in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

I am currently working on a research project focused on adversarial search in chess AI agents.
